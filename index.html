    <h1>A 20-Year-Old's Journey into AI: Animal Detection That Actually Works</h1>
    <p>By Massed Compute | June 2025</p>

  <div class="container">
    <p>
      Sunny Smith didn’t like deer eating his carefully planted garden. Instead of turning to traditional fencing or repellents, he turned to tech—and gave 20-year-old developer Tyler Sackel a challenge: build something smarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal? Create a hands-on AI project that would deter animals, provide real-world experience in deploying models, and demonstrate the power of Massed Compute’s hardware. What followed was a collaboration between curiosity and compute.
    </p>
    <p>
      At just 20 years old, I decided to build something that could combine my love for AI and my annoyance with deer trampling through the backyard. What started as a YOLOv8 experiment has now evolved into a full-fledged, real-time animal detection and deterrent system—hosted in the cloud and running on an RTX A6000.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
    <p>
      It all started with a problem: animals—mostly deer—kept destroying gardens and sneaking past fences. Motion lights weren’t cutting it, and I wondered if I could use object detection models to respond more intelligently.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      The system uses a Reolink infrared camera, detects motion using YOLO, and classifies the animal in real time. If a deer is detected, it triggers lights, sound, and even a sprinkler system—all controlled via smart relays. All of this runs on a Massed Compute-hosted server with GPU acceleration.

    <p>
      Here’s a moment I caught: a deer walks in, YOLO detects it, and within seconds the lights and sprinklers kick in. It ran off almost instantly.
    </p>

    <h2>What’s Under the Hood</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>YOLOv8 for fast and accurate animal detection</li>
      <li>Python + OpenCV to handle camera streams</li>
      <li>Flask web app to review footage and logs</li>
      <li>Smart device integration via Shelly relays</li>
      <li>All hosted on Massed Compute’s RTX A6000 platform</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
    <p>
      I’m expanding this to support multiple cameras, alert customization (email/SMS), and zone-based detection. Ultimately, I’d love to turn this into an installable smart system for homeowners and farms.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Thanks to Massed Compute</strong> for giving devs like me access to serious compute power without breaking the bank.</p>
